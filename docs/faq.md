### Why is it called LightningStream?

The project was inspired by [Litestream](https://litestream.io/), which does something similar for sqlite3 databases,
but without the simultaneous multi-writer capabilities. (TODO: rewrite)

The name is a play on that name, combined with the "Lightning" from LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database).
