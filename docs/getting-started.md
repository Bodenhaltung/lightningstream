# Getting started

This section explains how to get started with PowerDNS Authoratitive version 4.8+ and LightningStream.


!!! warning

    This page assumes the use of PowerDNS Authoratitive version 4.8 and higher, which uses [native LightningStream value headers](schema.md).

    TODO: explain how to use with 4.7. Can it work with 4.6?
